    Smartphones are increasingly being used to store personal
    information as well as to access sensitive data from the Internet and the
    cloud.

    I would like to put another paragraph in here. What would it look like? What
    would it be about? The options are endless with the proper amount of
    imagination.
\end{abstract}
